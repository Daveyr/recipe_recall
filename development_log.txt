RECIPE RECALL - DEVELOPMENT LOG
================================

PROJECT OBJECTIVE
-----------------
Create a web scraper to extract ingredients from BBC Good Food recipes using the 
class selector "ingredients-list list", and expose it as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) 
tool callable from Continue IDE.

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
----------------------
1. bbcgoodfood_scraper_yolo.py
   - Standalone Python script that searches BBC Good Food recipes
   - Extracts ingredients from ul.ingredients-list.list elements
   - Parses ingredients into quantity/unit/ingredient_name components
   - Handles text formatting quirks (e.g., "50gdried" → "50g dried")
   - Fully functional when run directly

2. fastmcp_quickstart.py
   - MCP server exposing scraper and utilities as callable tools
   - Tools: add_note, add, test_network, search_recipes
   - Uses stdio transport for subprocess communication
   - File logging to recipe_recall.log with timestamps

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED & SOLUTIONS
-------------------------------

Issue 1: Transport-level timeouts (-32001 Request timed out)
  Problem: HTTP-based transport layer had short default timeouts
  Solution: Switched from streamable-http to stdio (direct stdin/stdout)
  Result: ✅ Eliminated transport overhead

Issue 2: ModuleNotFoundError (requests, beautifulsoup4)
  Problem: Subprocess environment lacked project dependencies
  Solution: Wrapped scraper invocation with `uv run --with requests,bs4`
  Result: ✅ Dependencies available to subprocess

Issue 3: YAML syntax error in MCP configuration
  Problem: Invalid YAML mapping syntax in environment variables
  Solution: Converted `env: {C:\Windows}` to proper YAML `env: PATH: "C:\\Windows"`
  Result: ✅ Config file valid and loads correctly

Issue 4: Subprocess command timeout
  Problem: Increased subprocess timeout from 30s → 120s, MCP timeout 90s → 180s
  Solution: Acknowledged uv overhead and set reasonable limits
  Result: ✅ Timeout buffer in place

Issue 5: Subprocess hanging indefinitely (CRITICAL)
  Problem: subprocess.run() call never returned; logs stopped at subprocess entry
  Diagnosis: uv run was waiting for stdin input in non-TTY subprocess context
  Attempted Fix 1: Added --no-progress flag to suppress interactive output
    Result: ❌ Did not resolve hang
  Attempted Fix 2: Added excessive logging before/after subprocess call
    Result: ❌ Did not fix; logs confirmed subprocess never returned
  Final Solution: Added stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL to explicitly close stdin
    Result: ✅ RESOLVED - subprocess now completes successfully

FINAL STATUS
------------
✅ Web scraper fully functional and tested locally
✅ MCP server running without errors
✅ search_recipes tool now executes and returns results
✅ All tools accessible from Continue IDE via MCP interface
✅ Logging infrastructure working and writing to recipe_recall.log

TECHNICAL STACK
---------------
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Dependencies: requests, beautifulsoup4, mcp[cli], pandas
- Package Manager: uv
- MCP Framework: FastMCP
- Transport: stdio
- Target Website: www.bbcgoodfood.com

KEY LEARNINGS
-------------
1. subprocess.run() in non-TTY environments needs explicit stdin handling
2. uv run requires stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL when called from subprocess without terminal
3. Stdio transport superior to HTTP for MCP server communication
4. File-based logging critical for debugging subprocess execution issues
5. Each dependency isolation layer (uv, subprocess, async) adds complexity; 
   explicit configuration needed at each level

NEXT STEPS / POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------------------
- Add retry logic for network failures
- Cache search results to reduce BBC Good Food requests
- Extend scraper to extract other recipe metadata (prep time, servings, etc.)
- Add unit tests for ingredient parsing edge cases
- Consider async HTTP client (aiohttp) for parallel recipe fetching
